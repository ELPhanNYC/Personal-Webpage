  <p class = "center_align">Welcome to my "About Me" page. Here you can read more about my background, current experiences, and aspirations for the future.</p>

  <div style = "float:left; width: 47.50%;">
    <p> &emsp; Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Ethan Le Phan (Vietnamese: Phan le Thanh Nhan) and I am a sophomore at the University at Buffalo. I was born and raised in Medford, New York to parents of Vietnamese descent. On a day-to-day basis, I spend time with family and/or friends or try to learn new skills and attempt to put them to use in different projects like this website. Growing up I was very much intrigued with Rubik's Cubes and Legos, I spent the majority of my childhood playing with these toys and I believed it shaped who I am as a person. This is starting to sound like my <a href = "images/Final Draft.pdf">college essay</a>. Aside from playing with these toys, I also found myself enjoying various sports including basketball, volleyball, and badminton. During high school, I participated on the boy's Badminton team as a single or doubles player and was a player on my school's first Junior Varsity Volleyball team. I also participated in all 3 of my school's orchestras as a violinist. To this day, I still fine myself an avid volleyball player and love the feeling of winning with a team.</p>

    <p> &emsp; As of today, I still enjoy all of the aforementioned items yet also find myself engaged in aviation which leads to my love of traveling and different cultures. This brought with it my love for food and thus my interest seem to expand. I try to capture these interests and put them in video form on my youtube channel. On my YouTube channel I've also documented my experience as a freshman in college. While at college, I yearn to continue to learn new things and put them to use now or later on in my career. I've also spent time meeting, working, and connecting with new people whether they live in the same dormitory or have the same classes as me. My experience at UB Hacking also allowed me to improve my leadership skills as I lead a group of hackers in creating a simple web application. Furthermore, I am excited for to being my internship in the summer of 2023 at M&T Bank. Here I hope to continue growing as a computer scientist by learning more about the field and technologies used in the industry.</p>
