  <p class = "left_align"> &emsp; Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Ethan Phan and I am a sophomore at the University at Buffalo. I was born and raised in Medford, New York to parents of Vietnamese descent. On a day-to-day basis, I spend time with family and/or friends or try to learn new skills and attempt to put them to use in different projects like this website. Growing up I was very much intrigued with Rubik's Cubes and Legos. I spent the majority of my childhood playing with these toys and I believed it shaped who I am as a person. This is starting to sound like my <a href = "images/Final Draft.pdf">college essay</a>. Aside from playing with these toys, I also found myself enjoying various sports including basketball, volleyball, and badminton. During high school, I participated on the boy's Badminton team as a single or doubles player and was a player on my school's first Junior Varsity Volleyball team. I also participated in all 3 of my school's orchestras as a violinist. As of today, I still enjoy all of the aforementioned items yet also find myself engaged in aviation which leads to my love of traveling and different cultures. This brought with it my love for food and thus my interest seem to expand. I try to capture these interests and put them in video form on my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCntfnVlPRCxd69EGw9MRHQQ">youtube channel</a></a>. </p>
