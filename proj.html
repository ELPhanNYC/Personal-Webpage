    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom Grade Point Average Calculator  &emsp; <img src = 'images/python-logo.png' style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Wrote code for a GPA Calculator where the user is able to input their own grade cutoffs, assignment weighting, and assignment grades.</li>
                <li>The calculator returns both a raw (decimal) and letter GPA based on the provided data.</li>
                <li>The application runs in the users terminal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Custom Personal Website &emsp; <img src = 'images/js-html-css-logo.png' style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Constructed and designed a personal website that acts as an online portfolio.</li>
                <li>Website was uploaded to and hosted by GitHub.</li>
                <li>Apply frequent changes to reflect new projects or experiences.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Vaccination Data Web Application &emsp; <img src = 'images/python-logo.png' style="height: 24px;"> <img src = 'images/js-logo.png' style="height: 24px;"> <img src = 'images/html-logo.png' style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Assembled a web application that fetched CDC data and neatly displayed the data on a webpage that utilized plot.ly graphs and charts.</li>
                <li>The web application runs on a bottle server that uses AJAX to fetch the necessary data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Custom Genetic Algorithm &emsp; <img src = 'images/scala-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Engineered a custom genetic algorithm that could be used to produce the best solution to abstract problems given a data set incubator and a cost function.</li>
                <li>Algorithm created random decimals (genes) that were put in an incubator to create data samples stored in lists. The best samples are saved and mutated. More random genes were added to the list and the process was repeated via recursion.</li>
                <li>Algorithm utilized first-order functions and recursion to complete the task at hand.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enemy Artifical Intelligence &emsp; <img src = 'images/scala-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;"> <img src = 'images/html-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;"> <img src = 'images/js-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a computer-controlled enemy for a web-based game.</li>
                <li>The AI utilizes an algorithm that finds the location of the closest player and moves to attack.</li>
                <li>The algorithm relies on state variables, custom functions, and data structures such as linked list, trees, and graphs to store game data and find the closest player.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Self Checkout Machine &emsp; <img src = 'images/scala-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Engineered a Self Checkout Machine that takes in a barcode and gives the price of an item associated with a barcode.</li>
                <li>The system calculates a subtotal, tax, and a total given the items that were scanned.</li>
                <li>This application ulitizes object-oriented programming in order to insure the intended functionality</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Euclidean Distance Calculator &emsp; <img src = 'images/scala-logo.png'  style="height: 24px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Created an algorithm that takes in global coordinate points and returns the closest city relative to that point.</li>
                <li>The algorithm relies on a .csv file containin cities and their respective coordinates.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
